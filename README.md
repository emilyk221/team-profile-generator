  ## Description
  This application is a command-line application that allows the user to enter information about team members and displays that information in an easy to read format as a webpage. The team profile generator uses object oriented programming principles to generate employee objects with various roles on the team. The objects used are employee, manager, engineer, and intern. Unit tests are also written for each object to ensure the objects contain the correct type of information before using them. The application generates an HTML file after prompting the user to add all of the employees on their team and the user selects the "finish building my team" option from the main menu. This team profile generator is a useful tool for managers who want to see their team's contact information all in one place.
